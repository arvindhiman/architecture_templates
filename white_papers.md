## **Research / Architecture & Technical References**

1. **Lakehouse: A New Generation of Open Platforms that Unify Data Warehousing and Advanced Analytics**
   The foundational research paper on the lakehouse concept (open formats, unified analytics). ([cidrdb.org][10])

2. **A Survey of Legacy System Modernization Approaches** (SEI / CMU)
   A classic survey of techniques (wrapping, gateway, replication, componentization) that can inform your modernization strategy. ([SEI][11])

3. **Polynesia: Enabling Effective Hybrid Transactional/Analytical Databases with Specialized Hardware/Software Co-Design**
   A research system that addresses hybrid OLTP + OLAP workloads using in-memory + analytics islands, which may help inspire designs. ([arXiv][12])

4. **Cracking In-Memory Database Index: A Case Study for Adaptive Radix Tree Index**
   A technical exploration of improving index design in in-memory DBs — relevant when you consider modern memory-first architectures. ([arXiv][13])

5. **VerdictDB: Universalizing Approximate Query Processing**
   A middleware-based approach to add approximate query processing to existing engines without changing the backend DB — potentially relevant as an interim optimization. ([arXiv][14])
